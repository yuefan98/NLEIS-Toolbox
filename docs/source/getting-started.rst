=========================================
Getting started with :code:`nleis.py`
=========================================

:code:`nleis.py` is designed to be a toolbox that can be seamlessly integrated into :code:`impedance.py` to facilitate NLEIS analysis and simultaneous analysis of EIS and 2nd-NLEIS. nleis.py also supports building nonlinear equivalent circuit models. Due to the nonlinear nature, the smallest building block is the nonlinear Randles circuit in nleis.py, while a single resistor and capacitor are supported in impedance.py. In short, nleis.py requires a wrapper function for the pair of linear and nonlinear responses.

.. hint::
  If you get stuck or believe you have found a bug, please feel free to open an
  `issue on GitHub <https://github.com/yuefan98/nleis.py>`_.

Step 1: Installation
====================

If you are not familiar with :code:`impedance.py`, please first read `their documentation <https://impedancepy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html>`_ before exploring this toolbox. This toolbox is designed to be a toolbox for :code:`impedance.py`. Please follows the following instruction to setup an envrionment 
and install the :code:`nleis.py` from PyPI.

The best way to use this toolbox is creating a virtual environment using the :code:`environment.yml` file in the GitHub repo.

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create -f environment.yml

After conda creates this environment, we need to activate it before we can
install anything into it by using:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda activate nleis

We've now activated our conda environment and are ready to install :code:`nleis.py`.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    pip install nleis

Weâ€™ve now got everything in place to start analyzing our 2nd-NLEIS data!

Open Jupyter Lab
----------------

Next, we will launch an instance of Jupyter Lab:

.. code-block:: bash

  jupyter lab

which should open a new tab in your browser.

Step 2: Import your data
========================

To begin, we need to first load data from our 2nd-NLEIS manuscripts. The peer-reviewed paper for `Part I <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/ad15ca>`_ and `II <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/ad2596>`_ can be found from in Journal of Electrochemical Society.

Since there isn't a standard for data acquisition and preparation, the :code:`nleis.py` only provides a simple :code:`data_processing` to help users truncate their data. You will need to obtain your own frequencies, Z1, and Z2 data in order to use this function. A better data loading and processing function is under development.   

.. code-block:: python

    ## Loading the essential data
    import numpy as np
    frequencies = np.loadtxt('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuefan98/2nd-NLEIS-manuscripts/main/NLEIS_toolbox/data/freq_30a.txt')
    Z1 = np.loadtxt('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuefan98/2nd-NLEIS-manuscripts/main/NLEIS_toolbox/data/Z1s_30a.txt').view(complex)[1]
    Z2 = np.loadtxt('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuefan98/2nd-NLEIS-manuscripts/main/NLEIS_toolbox/data/Z2s_30a.txt').view(complex)[1]

Step 3: Process your data
==========================

Here, we provide a simple data processing function to help you truncate your data.

.. code-block:: python

    from nleis.nleis_fitting import data_processing

    f,Z1,Z2,f2_trunc,Z2_trunc = data_processing(frequencies,Z1,Z2)

Step 4: Define your model
==========================

Unlike :code:`impedance.py`, the smallest building block is a nonlinear Randles circuit (charge transfer only). Please refer to :doc:`examples/nleis_example` on how to define a nonlinear equivalent circuit model. In short, if you are familiar with linear ECM, you can easily create a nonlinear ECM by adding an `n` to the end of each linear element that can generate nonlinearity. 
The following example presents a cell model with porous electrodes composed of spherical particles for both the positive and negative electrodes. 
For EIS, the response of the two porous electrodes are in series with an ohmic resistance and an inductance (EIS_circuit). The 2nd-NLEIS response is defined as the difference between the responses of the positive and negative electrodes (NLEIS_circuit).

.. code-block:: python

    from nleis import EISandNLEIS
    
    EIS_circuit  = 'L0-R0-TDS0-TDS1'
    NLEIS_circuit  = 'd(TDSn0,TDSn1)'
    
    initial_guess = [1e-7,1e-3 # L0,RO
                       ,5e-3,1e-3,10,1e-2,100,10,0.1 ## TDS0 + additioal nonlinear parameters
                       ,1e-3,1e-3,1e-3,1e-2,1000,0,0 ## TDS1 + additioal nonlinear parameters
                       ]

Step 5: Fit to data 
==========================

We then need to initialize a :code:`EISandNLEIS` class for simultaneous analysis of EIS and 2nd-NLEIS.

.. code-block:: python

    circuit = EISandNLEIS(EIS_circuit, NLEIS_circuit, initial_guess = initial_guess)
    circuit.fit(f, Z1, Z2, opt = 'max');


Step 6: Visualize and print the results
========================================

.. code-block:: python
  
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    circuit.plot(f_data=f, Z1_data = Z1, Z2_data = Z2, kind = 'nyquist')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
    
    print(circuit)

.. image:: _static/example_fit.png

.. code-block:: python

.. important::
  ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You're now up and running with :code:`nleis.py` ðŸŽ‰ For those who are already acquainted with :code:`impedance.py`, I hope you'll discover the similarities with :code:`nleis.py` and appreciate how closely aligned they are at this point.

.. note:: 

   In `nleis.py`, the linear and nonlinear circuit elements are defined in pairs. The nonlinear element can be distinguished by an additional `n` after the linear circuit element. For example, the currently supported linear and nonlinear element pairs are shown as the following:

   - Nonlinear Randles circuit (charge transfer only): **`[RC,RCn]`**
   - Nonlinear Randles circuit with planar diffusion in a bounded thin film electrode: **`[RCD,RCDn]`**
   - Nonlinear Randles circuit with diffusion into a spherical electrode: **`[RCS,RCSn]`**
   - Porous electrode with high conductivity matrix (charge transfer only): **`[TP,TPn]`**
   - Porous electrode with high conductivity matrix and planar diffusion into platelet-like particles: **`[TDP,TDPn]`**
   - porous electrode with high conductivity matrix and diffusion into spherical particles: **`[TDS,TDSn]`**
   - Porous electrode with high conductivity matrix and diffusion into cylindrical particles: **`[TDC,TDCn]`**
  
  The nonlinear transmission line models (TLMs) and their corresponding current distribution functions are still under development. A detailed description will be included in the future.
   - Nonlinear Transmission Line model with two RC branches that describe surface and bulk behavior (charge transfer only): **`[TLM,TLMn]`**
   - Nonlinear Transmission Line model with two RC branches that describe surface and bulk behavior with diffusion into spherical particles: **`[TLMS,TLMSn]`**
   - Nonlinear Transmission Line model with two RC branches that describe surface and bulk behavior with diffusion into platelet-like particles: **`[TLMS,TLMSn]`**
